Twoboysoneshop Configr
----------------------

This module was our project of the Hackathon at the Magento Developers Paradise 2011.

The idea was to create an overview of all configuration values of all stores on one page
to be able to compare how the different stores are configured.


Features
--------
 - all values of all stores
 - select stores you want to compare
 - recognize value overrides by color
 - search for config keys


Installation
------------

Just move the content of the app directory to your magento installation.

Note
----

Our name is based on the romantic comedy "Two Girls One Cup". If you don't know about,
please DO NOT google it. Ignorance is bliss.
