# Twoboysoneshop Configr

This module was our project of the Hackathon at the Magento Developers Paradise 2011.

The idea was to create an overview of all configuration values of all stores on one page
to be able to compare how the different stores are configured.


## Features

### Overview
 - all values of all stores
 - select stores you want to compare
 - recognize value overrides by color (configurable)
 - search for config keys
 - tooltip for values of all scope
 - optional ACL check to view only allowed sections
 - PLANNED: in-place-edit of config values

### History
 - track config changes
 - show history of changed config values
 - restore config changes
 - generate migration script from selected changes


## Installation

Just move the content of the app directory to your magento installation.

## Note

Our name is based on the romantic comedy "Two Girls One Cup". If you don't know about it,
please DO NOT google it. Ignorance is bliss.
